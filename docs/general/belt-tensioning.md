# Belt tensioning

{: .note}
> This guide is still a work in progress.

Belt tensioning is an important part of achieving good performance on your VzBoT printer. The specifications and numbers for tuning your printer may differ slightly between models and versions, but the steps for achieving these results are largely the same for all of them.

## What you will need

- A mobile phone or tablet
- Frequency analyzer application
- Quiet environment
- Tools for motor mounts

### VzBoT-330

The Vz330 belt tensioners are located at the back of the printer. Loosen the fixing screw on the rear motor mounts before turning the tensioning screw. Tighten the fixing screw back up when you're done adjusting belt tension.

Recommended target acoustic frequency:

- Printed version: 110Hz
- CNC / Mellow kit: 130Hz

Put the gantry in the center or roughly 150mm's from the front and use the 2 short belts on the Front Left and Right side from Idler/motor to X gantry Pulley. Use the green sections to measure the Freq.

### VzBoT-235

The Vz235 belt tensioners are located at the front of the printer, either side of the front doors. Loosen the fixing screw on the rear motor mounts before turning the tensioning screw. Tighten the fixing screw back up when you're done adjusting belt tension.

Recommended target acoustic frequency:

- Printed version: 110Hz
- CNC / Mellow kit: 130Hz

Put  at roughly 150mm's from the front and use the 2 short belts on the front Left and Right side from idler/motor to X gantry pulley. Use the green sections to measure the Freq.
